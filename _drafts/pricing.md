# Disclaimer

Please note that the contents of this website, and especially of this page, do not constitute a commercial offer as specified by article 66 of Polish Civil Code. The purpose of below price lists is to provide prospective contractors with an estimate as of the time of viewing this page, however the final rates and contract details are subject to negotiation by either party, depending on circumstances. For practical reasons, I only accept contracts in the form of written aggreement approved and signed by both parties (paperback, digital, or both), based on Polish Civil Code rather than foreign lawmaking, and written down in Polish, English, or bilingual. 

Moreover, I may refuse to provide services to a contractor under reasonable circumstances, such as:
- Insufficient capacity to provide requested services,
- Poor reputation of, and/or negative past experiences with a contractor,
- Contractor's unethical practices and/or affiliation with entities involved in unethical practices,
- Insistence on unfavourable terms of the contract.

# My Services

I am more than happy to offer my services as a Software Engineer, as well as any kind of consultant/contractor to provide any of the following:
- Systems Auditing & Consultancy - to provide you with insights on why your system may face its current struggles, or what kind of struggles should you anticipate, as well as analysis and recommendations on system design, SDLC processes design, or to address a particular challenge that comes across,
- Trainings - if you have know-how shortages, I can arrange training sessions for your team on select topics,
- Software Engineering - I can join your team directly as a Software Engineer, in order to contribute directly in my areas of expertise

Please be mindful that if you are looking for trainings on a very particular tool or technology, it is likely more effective to reach out to certified and professional trainers on the subject. I might have relevant experience by happenstance, or be able to advise you on what to look our for when working with a particular kind of tools - say, public cloud vendors - however this may not suffice if you are looking for a "deep dive" course.

# Rates and fees

## Regular rates

| Service | Rate in PLN | Rate in EUR | Unit / Type | Notes |
| ------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----- |
| Systems Auditing & Consultancy | 250-500 | 60-120 | hourly | Includes system analysis, knowledge transfer meetings, design work, preparation of raports, documentation and diagramming, participation in/facilitation of brainstorming and similar sessions. |

## Additional fees

**Note**: These fees are in fact meant to discourage behaviours and interactions I prefer to avoid in professional settings, rather than to provide "extra" services. I prefer to provide services to contractors whom I would rarely, if ever, need to charge with these fees on top of regular rates.

| ---- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------ |
