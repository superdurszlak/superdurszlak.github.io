This post is a **case study**. Since it is based on real-life situations I have experienced or witnessed, 
some details - most notably dates and names - had to be changed or anonymized to avoid legal disputes with
organizations or disclosing identities of persons involved. That being said, there might be inaccuracies, however
I put my best efforts to keep the merit highlighted in the study.
