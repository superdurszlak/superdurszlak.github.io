## Disclaimer

Please note that the contents of this website, and especially of this page, do not constitute a commercial offer as specified by article 66 of Polish Civil Code. The purpose of below price lists is to provide prospective clients with an estimate, however the final rates and contract details are subject to negotiation by either party, depending on circumstances. For practical reasons, I only accept contracts in the form of written aggreement approved and signed by both parties (paperback, digital, or both), based on Polish Civil Code and EU regulations rather than foreign legislation, and written down in Polish, English, or bilingual. 

Moreover, under certain circumstances I might refuse to provide services, most notably due to limited capacity and in face of doubtful reputation and ethics of the prospective client.

## My Services

I am more than happy to offer my services as a Software Engineer:
- Systems Auditing & Consultancy - to provide you with insights on why your system may face its current struggles, or what kind of struggles should you anticipate, as well as analysis and recommendations on system design, SDLC processes design, or to address a particular challenge that comes across,
- Trainings - if you have know-how shortages, I can arrange training sessions for your team on select topics,
- Software Engineering - I can join your team directly as a Software Engineer, in order to contribute directly in my areas of expertise

Please be mindful that if you are looking for in-depth trainings on a particular tool or technology, it is likely more effective to reach out to certified and professional subject matter experts. I might have relevant experience by happenstance, or be able to advise you on what to look our for, or which entity to contact when working with a particular kind of tools - say, public cloud vendors - however, this may not suffice if you are looking for a "deep dive" course.

## Rates and fees

### Regular rates

| Service | <nobr>Rate in PLN</nobr> | <nobr>Rate in EUR</nobr> | <nobr>Unit / Type</nobr> | Notes |

### Additional fees

**Note**: These fees are in fact meant to discourage behaviours and interactions I prefer to avoid in professional settings, rather than to provide "extra" services. I would prefer such situations to be exceptional, rather than charge my clients with these fees on a regular basis, nevertheless they do happen. The point here is to respect each other's time - I highly value settings where I am able to deliver meaningful results of tangible value in reasonable time.
