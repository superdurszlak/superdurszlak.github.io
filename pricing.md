## My Services

I am willing to offer my services as a Software Engineer:
- Systems Auditing & Consultancy - to provide you with insights on why your system may face its current struggles, or what kind of struggles should you anticipate, as well as analysis and recommendations on system design, SDLC processes design, or to address a particular challenge that comes across,
- Trainings - if you have know-how shortages, I can arrange training sessions for your team on select topics,
- Software Engineering - I can join your team directly as a Software Engineer, in order to contribute to the project in my areas of expertise

Please be mindful that if you are looking for in-depth trainings on a particular tool or technology, it is likely more effective to reach out to certified and professional subject matter experts. I might have relevant experience by happenstance, or be able to advise you on what to look our for, or which entity to contact when working with a particular kind of tools - say, public cloud vendors - however, this may not suffice if you are looking for a "deep dive" course.

For best value, consider the areas I am most experienced in:
- Distributed systems design,
- Distributed / parallel computing,
- Cloud-based back-end systems,
- CI/CD,
- SDLC processes and infrastructure management automation,
- Observability.

### Time management fees

**Note**: The reason for these fees is to ensure we respect each other's time - I highly value settings where I am able to deliver meaningful results within reasonable time. While I am aware situations listed there are not always avoidable, it is important for me to discourage behaviours and interactions which have negative impact on my productivity, so that they remain an exception rather than a rule in professional settings. This allows me to not only build a healthy work environment, but also preserve the ability to deliver value to the clients.

## Availability

To learn about my current availability, please contact me via LinkedIn or e-mail.

Please do not hesitate to let me know how would you like to verify my qualifications before starting collaboration. I am open to provide references or participate in a relevant recruitment process if needed, such as system design sessions or live coding, however I might not be interested in time-consuming processes free of charge. Especially, I generally withdraw from processes requiring me to complete a "homework" assignment, as the scope usually requires from several hours to days.

## Disclaimer

Please note that the contents of this website, and especially of this page, do not constitute a commercial offer as specified by article 66 of Polish Civil Code. The purpose of above price lists is to provide prospective clients with an estimated cost of my services, however the final rates are subject to negotiation by either party, depending on circumstances.

For practical reasons, I only accept contracts in the form of a written aggreement approved and signed by both parties (paperback, digital, or both), based on Polish Civil Code and EU regulations rather than foreign legislation, and written down in either Polish, English, or bilingual.

Moreover, under certain circumstances I might refuse to provide services, most notably due to limited capacity and in case the prospective client's reputation and ethics raise questions.
