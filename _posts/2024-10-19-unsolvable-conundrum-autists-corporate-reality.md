Have you ever wondered what does it feel like to navigate a strongly neurotypical workplace as an autist? We have already explored what one can experience as an autistic individual in [{{ autism_post.title }}]({{ autism_post.url }}) - this time, we will take a look at workplace struggles, which I find fairly typical - that is, they tend to re-occur in various workplaces in slightly different ways. Long story short - it is a lifetime struggle to fit in, a battle we are destined to lose, a labyrinth which keeps shape-shifting and seemingly has no way out. And since the labyrinth is made out of human emotions, unwritten rules, non-verbal communication and implicit expectations, we autists often end up navigating it blindfolded.

This post is based on some of my personal workplace experiences, and is written from my perspective. Almost all of these situations happened while I was still undiagnosed, and only suspected there must be _something wrong_ with me.

It is entirely possible that a neurotypical - or neurodiverse, but differently - person would perceive some of these as non-issues, or see me as unprofessional due to inability to deal with such situations. It is entirely possible that I am, indeed, having issues with non-issues and keep handling them unprofessionally - though this is precisely why my limitations are _limitations_.

## Unclear communication

There are many ways corporate communication can become confusing for an autistic individual:
- Culture of avoiding positive or negative tone,
- Unwritten rules about communication,
- Messages defying actual actions,
- Channels which may not be suitable for neurodivergent people,
- Unexpressed expectations.

### Postive / negative tone avoidance

Given culture might not allow to convey negative or positive message explicitly - so you must be able to read between the lines. Arguably, it happens more often that everything has to be phrased positively - so you are bound to hear everything you do is great, at most with a little _but_. Likewise, _you_ are expected to follow suit and if you find it appropriate to criticize someone, you better praise them instead or not say anything at all.

The tone of communication conveyed does not follow a distribution you could reasonably expect - some positives, some negatives, mostly something in between. The actual message would be passed between the lines. To me, such communication is simply uniform, as I rarely see things _between the lines_, and even when I do, I do not trust myself as I misinterpret more often than not. For this reason, over time I either stop reacting to positive messages (since I find them meaningless) or become frightened with sheer amount of criticism I receive, with no way of telling if / how I can improve, feeling trapped since a honest conversation is apparently not an option.

In such circumstances, it is easy for an autist to become an outlier, and stick out like a sore thumb. Various things can happen:
- Your stress levels could become excessively high,
- You would miss criticism or negative feedback if it is passed indirectly,
- Likewise, you would not take actual praises seriously and feel unappreciated, since it is near impossible to tell a genuine praise apart from veiled criticism,
- You may give someone feedback in a way that is not acceptable in given corporate culture - for instance, in a direct manner instead of cushioning it, or by not cushioning it sufficiently to meet the standards.
