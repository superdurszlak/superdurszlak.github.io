## Abstract

Distributed systems and especially microservices are often a go-to solution for organizations seeking modernity, scalability and growth opportunities. What is often overlooked, though, is that as the scale of our infrastructure keeps growing, so does the scale of any inefficiencies introduced along the way. While few would find it worth investigating whether service's upkeep could be cut from USD 200 down to USD 100 per month, the sum becomes non-trivial if we could cut the costs of running hundreds of microservices, several instances each.

In this post, we will explore a number of examples where teams or organizations realized (or not) they are over-spending on their infrastructure at scale.

## Over-provisioning of resources

## Unshared cloud resources

## Excessive metrics cardinality

## Massive logs ingest

## Maintenance cost and overhead

## Resource-hungry tech stack

## Unrestricted scalability

## Barely used applications
