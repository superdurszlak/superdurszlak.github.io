## Abstract

Building distributed systems is easier said than done. Putting aside the technical complexity and challenges that come with designing, developing and maintaining distributed systems, organizations need to figure out how to coordinate the efforts of their engineering teams, so that the results are delivered in finite time, at an acceptable cost, and make at least some sense for the business. This is easier said than done, and there is a reason why [Conway's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law) is one of the more popular terms in the microservices world. Time and again, reality proves the outcomes of an organization's efforts reflect its internal structure's efficiency - or deficiency.

In this article, we will take a look at a few examples of how organizational structure and internal regulations affected how the distributed systems were being built by the engineering teams, and what effects it had on system maintainability, reliability, and efficiency.
