Have you ever wondered, what does it feel like to navigate a strongly neurotypical workplace as an autist? We have already explored what one can experience as an autistic individual in [{{ autism_post.title }}]({{ autism_post.url }}) - this time, we will take a look at workplace struggles, which I find fairly typical - that is, they tend to re-occur in various workplaces in slightly different ways, though the patterns and themes prevail. 

Long story short - it is a lifetime struggle to fit in, a battle we are destined to lose, a labyrinth which keeps shape-shifting and seemingly has no way out. And since the labyrinth is made out of human emotions, unwritten rules, non-verbal communication and implicit expectations, we autists often end up navigating it blindfolded.

This post is based on some of my personal workplace experiences, and is written from my perspective. Almost all of these situations happened while I was still undiagnosed, and only suspected there must be _something wrong_ with me. I will refrain from assuming bad faith and ill intentions for this reason. However, I cannot deny many of such situations show it is not only autists who struggle with flexibility and ability do understand different perspectives and communication styles.

It is entirely possible that a neurotypical - or neurodiverse, but differently - person would perceive some of these as non-issues, or see me as unprofessional due to inability to deal with such situations. It is entirely possible that I am, indeed, having issues with non-issues and keep handling them unprofessionally - though this is precisely why my limitations are _limitations_.

## Unclear communication

There are many ways corporate communication can become confusing for an autistic individual:
- Culture of avoiding positive or negative tone,
- Unwritten rules about communication,
- Messages defying actual actions,
- Channels which may not be suitable for neurodivergent people,
- Unexpressed expectations.

### Positive / negative tone avoidance

Given culture might not allow to convey negative or positive message explicitly - so you must be able to read between the lines. Arguably, it happens more often than not that everything has to be phrased positively - so you are bound to hear everything you do is great, at most with a little _but_. Likewise, _you_ are expected to follow suit and if you find it appropriate to criticize someone, you better praise them instead or not say anything at all.

The tone of communication conveyed does not follow a distribution you could reasonably expect - some positives, some negatives, mostly something in between. The actual message would be passed between the lines. To me, such communication is simply uniform, as I rarely see things _between the lines_, and even when I do, I do not trust myself as I misinterpret more often than not. For this reason, over time I either stop reacting to positive messages (since I find them meaningless) or become frightened with sheer amount of criticism I receive, with no way of telling if / how I can improve, feeling trapped since a honest conversation is apparently not an option.

#### How does it manifest itself?

In such circumstances, it is easy for an autist to become an outlier, and stick out like a sore thumb. Various things can happen:
- Your stress levels could become excessively high,
- You would miss criticism or negative feedback if it is passed indirectly,
- Likewise, you would not take actual praises seriously and feel unappreciated, since it is near impossible to tell a genuine praise apart from veiled criticism,
- You may give someone feedback in a way that is not acceptable in given corporate culture - for instance, in a direct manner instead of cushioning it, or by not cushioning it sufficiently to meet the standards.
- You may not express excitement sufficiently, and you would be perceived as negative and a party popper. As it happens, I am not good at pretending and I rarely get excited about anything, and it is almost never the thing corporate would expect me to be excited about. In an extreme case, due to this (and due to following escalation path in certain circumstances) I ended up with an annual performance review calling me _a two-faced person_.

#### Why do I struggle with this as an autist?

The primary reason why it is difficult to navigate such environment is taking communication at face value. In order to be able to understand what the other person needs, I need them to speak about it openly rather than expect me to read their mind. Likewise, when I communicate with others, I usually choose direct, transparent and open (sometimes overly open) communication style as this is the kind of message I would appreciate and find understandable. As it happens, such style is often found offensive by neurotypical people, especially from strongly hierarchical and indirect cultures. It is typically assumed I do this with malicious intent, and I rarely get a chance to explain myself - and never on equal footing.

### Unwritten rules

Every culture has its own sets of taboos and unwritten rules, and corporate cultures are no different. Such cultural norms do not get written down anywhere, but often take precedence over rules and policies that _do_ get put into writing.

#### What unwritten rules can I miss?

Examples of such unwritten rules include:
- Not participating in certain meetings you are required to attend to - depending on various factors, such as power distance between you and the highest-ranking person in a meeting. In extreme cases, I was reprimanded for speaking up in technical meetings in presence of people with the same role I had, but with longer tenure in the team. Even several months of difference could be enough.
- Not disagreeing with certain people in your project, regardless of the merit of their statements - most of the time, nobody would tell you up-front that some people are too important, sensitive, or both, to be disagreed with. You should not mess with _the big man_ - frankly, it's almost never a woman, males are _the_ corporate drama queens - though nobody would tell you, since everybody considers it obvious. You correct _the big man_ in good faith, and now it's _you_ who is in trouble.
- Some technical debt should not be touched - it is sometimes an extension of the previous rule, since paying off this tech debt would be on par with saying _the big man_ was wrong some years ago. Otherwise, the team may strongly believe they are following best practices - for instance, due to inexperience with certain technology - and you should rather forsake your own experience with it, than mess with the team. This is another great opportunity for an autist like me to cause a major drama by attempting to contribute in good faith.
- Certain technical topics should not be raised by someone below a certain level - it is one of the most difficult rules for me to deal with. Pre-pandemic, I grew used to being encouraged to set the bar higher to foster growth. Post-pandemic, and several years of service later, I am not allowed to take on challenges I could successfully tackle as a Junior Software Engineer years ago, and it is now customary that even as a Software Engineer II I should not get involved. Likewise, anytime I encourage my peers to participate in particular initiatives, they would rather back off. 

#### Autistic percpetion of unwritten rules

Autistic people miss such rules quite frequently - most of the time, they would not realize they are in place until they are explicitly told about them. To add insult to injury, such unwritten rules may be highly contextual, that is they apply in some cases, however in others they don't, or even worse, the opposite behavior should be applied. It is fairly typical for an autist to miss such nuances - so, even if we succeed at learning these rules, we will follow them at inappropriate moments.

On top of that, if such rules are set in a convoluted, nuanced and emotional way, it makes things worse for people like myself - it is inherently difficult, if not impossible for me to internalize, understand and accept rules that are not logical, rational and serving a practical purpose. In fact, I find practicality paramount, and I find it highly impractical to protect anybody's overgrown ego at the company's and coworkers' expense.
