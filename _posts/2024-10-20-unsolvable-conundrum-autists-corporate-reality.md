Have you ever wondered, what does it feel like to navigate a strongly neurotypical workplace as an autist? We have already explored what one can experience as an autistic individual in [{{ autism_post.title }}]({{ autism_post.url }}) - this time, we will take a look at workplace struggles, which I find fairly typical - that is, they tend to re-occur in various workplaces in slightly different ways, though the patterns and themes prevail. 

Long story short - it is a lifetime struggle to fit in, a battle we are destined to lose, a labyrinth which keeps shape-shifting and seemingly has no way out. And since the labyrinth is made out of human emotions, unwritten rules, non-verbal communication and implicit expectations, we autists often end up navigating it blindfolded.

This post is based on some of my personal workplace experiences, and is written from my perspective. Almost all of these situations happened while I was still undiagnosed, and only suspected there must be _something wrong_ with me. I will refrain from assuming bad faith and ill intentions for this reason. However, I cannot deny many of such situations show it is not only autists who struggle with flexibility and ability do understand different perspectives and communication styles.

It is entirely possible that a neurotypical - or neurodiverse, but differently - person would perceive some of these as non-issues, or see me as unprofessional due to inability to deal with such situations. It is entirely possible that I am, indeed, having issues with non-issues and keep handling them unprofessionally - though this is precisely why my limitations are _limitations_.

There are many ways corporate environment can become confusing for an autistic individual:
- Culture of avoiding positive or negative tone,
- Unwritten rules about communication,
- Messages defying actual actions,
- Channels which may not be suitable for neurodivergent people,
- Unexpressed expectations,
- Corporate ladder and development path not matching one's individual development,
- Stiff performance review process,
- Inconsistent standards.

## Positive / negative tone avoidance

Given culture might not allow to convey negative or positive message explicitly - so you must be able to read between the lines. Arguably, it happens more often than not that everything has to be phrased positively - so you are bound to hear everything you do is great, at most with a little _but_. Likewise, _you_ are expected to follow suit and if you find it appropriate to criticize someone, you better praise them instead or not say anything at all.

The tone of communication conveyed does not follow a distribution you could reasonably expect - some positives, some negatives, mostly something in between. The actual message would be passed between the lines. To me, such communication is simply uniform, as I rarely see things _between the lines_, and even when I do, I do not trust myself as I misinterpret more often than not. For this reason, over time I either stop reacting to positive messages (since I find them meaningless) or become frightened with sheer amount of criticism I receive, with no way of telling if / how I can improve, feeling trapped since a honest conversation is apparently not an option.

### How does it manifest itself?

In such circumstances, it is easy for an autist to become an outlier, and stick out like a sore thumb. Various things can happen:
- Your stress levels could become excessively high,
- You would miss criticism or negative feedback if it is passed indirectly,
- Likewise, you would not take actual praises seriously and feel unappreciated, since it is near impossible to tell a genuine praise apart from veiled criticism,
- You may give someone feedback in a way that is not acceptable in given corporate culture - for instance, in a direct manner instead of cushioning it, or by not cushioning it sufficiently to meet the standards.
- You may not express excitement sufficiently, and you would be perceived as negative and a party popper. As it happens, I am not good at pretending and I rarely get excited about anything, and it is almost never the thing corporate would expect me to be excited about. In an extreme case, due to this (and due to following escalation path in certain circumstances) I ended up with an annual performance review calling me _a two-faced person_.

### Why do I struggle with this as an autist?

The primary reason why it is difficult to navigate such environment is taking communication at face value. In order to be able to understand what the other person needs, I need them to speak about it openly rather than expect me to read their mind. Likewise, when I communicate with others, I usually choose direct, transparent and open (sometimes overly open) communication style as this is the kind of message I would appreciate and find understandable. As it happens, such style is often found offensive by neurotypical people, especially from strongly hierarchical and indirect cultures. It is typically assumed I do this with malicious intent, and I rarely get a chance to explain myself - and never on equal footing.

### How can this be addressed?

Unfortunately, my limitations are pretty much hard-wired into my brain - there is more and more research and evidence on differences between autistic and neurotypical brains. Differences include:
- Different brain structure - some areas may be more or less developed in an autistic brain,
- Atypical brain activity and connections between various areas - same stimuli may activate entirely different areas than in a neurotypical brain, and the degree of activation may vary too,
- We process the same inputs, but not in the same way - as evidenced by impaired ability to read between the lines. Other examples include over- and under-sensitivities to stimuli such as light or sound,
- Even brain size seems to be different - I always tended to have a significantly larger head than my peers, and it was often ridiculed at school and at work. My fellow autistic friend also has an unusually large head, and statistically speaking, autists seem to be perceived as younger than their true age due to distorted body size proportions.

The only viable solution to this seems to embracing direct and honest communication. With almost 30 years of experience in being punished and reprimanded into submission, I can personally attest such measures are highly ineffective, however they seem to be a go-to solution in both educational and workplace settings.

## Unwritten rules

Every culture has its own sets of taboos and unwritten rules, and corporate cultures are no different. Such cultural norms do not get written down anywhere, but often take precedence over rules and policies that _do_ get put into writing.

### What unwritten rules can I miss?

Examples of such unwritten rules include:
- Not participating in certain meetings you are required to attend to - depending on various factors, such as power distance between you and the highest-ranking person in a meeting. In extreme cases, I was reprimanded for speaking up in technical meetings in presence of people with the same role I had, but with longer tenure in the team. Even several months of difference could be enough.
- Not disagreeing with certain people in your project, regardless of the merit of their statements - most of the time, nobody would tell you up-front that some people are too important, sensitive, or both, to be disagreed with. You should not mess with _the big man_ - frankly, it's almost never a woman, males are _the_ corporate drama queens - though nobody would tell you, since everybody considers it obvious. You correct _the big man_ in good faith, and now it's _you_ who is in trouble.
- Some technical debt should not be touched - it is sometimes an extension of the previous rule, since paying off this tech debt would be on par with saying _the big man_ was wrong some years ago. Otherwise, the team may strongly believe they are following best practices - for instance, due to inexperience with certain technology - and you should rather forsake your own experience with it, than mess with the team. This is another great opportunity for an autist like me to cause a major drama by attempting to contribute in good faith.
- Certain technical topics should not be raised by someone below a certain level - it is one of the most difficult rules for me to deal with. Pre-pandemic, I grew used to being encouraged to set the bar higher to foster growth. Post-pandemic, and several years of service later, I am not allowed to take on challenges I could successfully tackle as a Junior Software Engineer years ago, and it is now customary that even as a Software Engineer II I should not get involved. Likewise, anytime I encourage my peers to participate in particular initiatives, they would rather back off. 

### Autistic perception of unwritten rules

Autistic people miss such rules quite frequently - most of the time, they would not realize they are in place until they are explicitly told about them. To add insult to injury, such unwritten rules may be highly contextual, that is they apply in some cases, however in others they don't, or even worse, the opposite behavior should be applied. It is fairly typical for an autist to miss such nuances - so, even if we succeed at learning these rules, we will follow them at inappropriate moments.

On top of that, if such rules are set in a convoluted, nuanced and emotional way, it makes things worse for people like myself - it is inherently difficult, if not impossible for me to internalize, understand and accept rules that are not logical, rational and serving a practical purpose. In fact, I find practicality paramount, and I find it highly impractical to protect anybody's overgrown ego at the company's and coworkers' expense.

### Can anything be done about this?

It would be far easier to follow corporate rules if they were:
- Put into writing,
- Easily accessible for reference,
- Had an explicit explanation why they were put in place,
- Followed common sense and logic rather than emotions.

## Communication vs action 

As it happens, corporate culture is often all about impressions and declarations, however actions rarely follow suit after what is being communicated - and almost never consistently. I am aware it is not always possible to stay true to one's own declarations - things go south, we are all stressed out, and sometimes we just have to cut corners. However, as an autistic person I am quite sensitive to such inconsistency - and find it highly confusing, frequently increasing my stress level.

### How does such inconsistency manifest itself?

There are many ways in which companies and teams do not stay true to their own statements - at least in my personal perception:
- Company values may include prioritizing customer experience, but then there is no Quality Assurance in place, and I am being told I should not test my changes since there is no time,
- An employer may emphasize transparent communication, and then they would introduce policies without prior notice, with retroactive dates, or even without informing employees about the policy's details,
- I may be told the timeline is tight and there is no time for technical improvements, only to end up stuck and unable to meet deadlines because of technical debt - but still forbidden to address even the smallest wins,
- Likewise, the team might claim the deadlines are close and we need to postpone certain efforts, but continue attending fruitless and unrelated meetings or stick to inefficient ways of working.
- I once joined a company boasting about its highly egalitarian, open Swedish work culture, only to find out internally it is quite hierarchical, and decisions are made behind the scenes without team's input.

### How do I perceive such situations?

To put it bluntly, if I notice one's actions defy one's declarations, I would find them to be dishonest and undependable. After all, how can I count on my teammate or employer, if things they do are the opposite of what they say? In such circumstances, if I do not quit or change the team immediately, I tend to grow increasingly grumpy, distrustful, and stressed out since I cannot possibly know what to expect. Either way, it is not healthy nor comfortable for me to end up job skipping for such reasons, nor for the company to hire someone only to discourage them from getting engaged due to lack of integrity.

## Unsuitable communication channels 

The differences in how I process information make it easier for me to process some kinds of information, while highly difficult if not impossible to deal with others. It is often advised to support neurodivergent people - not only autistics, but also those with ADHD - with written communication, such as putting instructions in writing rather than only passing them in speech.

### What kind of struggles may an autist experience?

Based on my own experiences and perception, I could name a few examples of what kind of communication gives me a hard time:
- Using speech in a moderately loud environment - I can spot a whistling kettle from far away, or hear AC wires buzzing quietly inside a socket, but if someone talks to me quietly when a dishwasher is working or asks me a random question in an open space on a busy day - most likely I would not be able to distinguish the words they are saying. It is not even a matter of language unfamiliarity - I have the exact same problem when a person is speaking to me in Polish and English. In fact, I would find it easier to understand a Czech (I don't speak Czech) or German (I barely speak German) person in a quiet space, than to understand a Polish native speaker at a bus stop near a busy road.
- Using spoken language as a primary form of communication - cultural differences play a role here. For instance, my Indian co-workers are quite notorious for requiring me to communicate in speech rather than text. Instead of reading a message or ticket description, they would rather call me and ask to repeat, similarly if I ask for code review my Indian colleagues would prefer to go through the PR on a call rather than put written comments. Likewise, while I worked in an almost exclusively Indian team, the Jira tickets would be left almost empty, and all instructions would be given during a meeting and not written down. Likewise, knowledge base was full of meeting recordings rather than written documentation.
- Even if something is put into writing, it may not be accessible for other reasons. The information could be sent via an unexpected channel, or scattered across multiple random destinations, and you need to know where to look for it or whom to ask about it to get access. Sometimes it is, again, assumed to be _obvious_ this is how information is stored. All of this adds difficulty in a needless manner.
- Using confusing vocabulary and abbreviations - it is another layer of complexity which make communication harder for me. Using class naming conventions which do not convey the actual responsibility of a class makes code highly confusing for me. Similarly, it may seem cool to name a microservice _Hercules_, but then it would become a mind-boggling conundrum for me to reason about interactions between _Hercules_, _Hades_ and _Anubis_ than between some mundane _MailServer_, _PurchaseNotifier_ and maybe _SalesHistory_. Likewise, I get hopelessly lost in abbreviations like _BCP_, _ICS_, _GWDC_, _NYWB_ and whatnot, even after months of exposure.

### How can one improve communication with a neurodivergent person?

From my personal perspective, there are various ways communication with me may be improved:
- Use written, asynchronous communication as a primary way of communicating with me. Asynchronous does not mean I am not available right now - I may respond immediately, but I may also need to read your inquiry thoroughly, think about an answer, do some research, put it into words and go back to you after a few minutes or hours.
- If you need to talk to me, ensure I am able to understand you. Choose a quiet, moderately secluded area where there would be fewer distractions - such as less crowded corridor as opposed to open space full of people in video calls, or a kitchen full of chatting people.
- Put all agreements and requirements into writing, and make it easily accessible for our future selves. That way, it would be easier for me to find it later on, and reference it.
- Ensure the communication is clear and to the point - fancy names, uncommon abbreviations and chaotic, unstructured text only make it harder for me to understand your intent.

## Unexpressed expectations 

In some corporate cultures, there are certain expectations about what you should or should not do, and they are often assumed to be too obvious to be written down and communicated explicitly. Such expectations are usually closely related to other aspects of corporate culture, such as:
- Indirect communication,
- Hierarchical environment,
- Unwritten rules.

### How such expectations affect autistic people?

In short, the outcomes are rather similar to other aspects of indirectness and implicit communication:
- If something is not clearly expected to be done, an autist may remain oblivious to it, or simply choose not to do it. After all, if something is not required explicitly, it must be rather unimportant, and perhaps optional.
- Likewise, if an expectation is set in a rather indirect and cushioned way, we may underappreciate its importance. For instance, if a requirement is critical and must not be refused, but it is put into words that suggest otherwise do soften the message, I would not be able to read one's mind and realize its actual criticality.
- It works in the opposite way, too. It was often pointed out that at my level, I should not get involved or give feedback about certain technical aspects. I find such feedback confusing and not quite understandable - if I get hired for a technical role, and happen to have certain experience in certain technical aspect, it is rather natural for me that I should use it to contribute, rather than pretend I do not have certain qualifications.

### What can help an autist do a better job at meeting expectations?

If it is truly important to do (or not do) something, the best way is to be open and direct about it. It is immensely helpful to communicate all vital expectations directly, and similarly be precise about which requirements are only optional, conditional or nice-to-have. This way, chances that I would meet your expectations are greatly increased, since the single crucial obstacle is removed.

The communication about expectations can be further improved by providing a logical explanation of why given requirement is in place and why its priority is higher or lower than others. This way, it makes it easier for an autistic person to align with this expectation, and even advocate for them themselves.

Lastly, if my strengths and abilities contrast with what is expected of me, it is better to establish a way to contribute with my strengths without crossing the line. Otherwise, if my abilities are forcibly suppressed by corporate culture and policies, while my weaknesses are left exposed and punished, I am bound to feel unappreciated and unable to contribute, greatly undermining my motivation and commitment. Regardless of compensation and job title, I find it deeply disturbing if I have to deliberately conceal my qualifications simply because a person with certain job title is not allowed to have those. 

## Stiff performance review process



## Inconsistent standards


## Summary

Life of an autistic person is not easy in corporate reality. Everyday struggles experienced by neurodiverse people, including autists, contribute to elevated stress levels and often prevents us from being our best selves. As a result, it may lead to frequent job changes - as in my case, hampered professional development, and in extreme cases, even unemployment and being excluded from the job market entirely.

I can only hope that over the next few decades, workplaces would become more inclusive and understanding for neurodivergent individuals. As of now, I see a rather opposite trend, with employers setting the bar ever higher in terms of social and interpersonal skills, and punishing employees who fail to meet these standards. Hopefully, the next generations of employees would not have to experience such struggles themselves.
