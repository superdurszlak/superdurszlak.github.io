## Abstract

Time and again, we take each other and our future selves by surprise - by not collecting metrics, not documenting our software projects and APIs, or by forgetting that something important is running on that cobweb-covered server we are about to unplug.

We all learn from mistakes, though it is only as effective as our ability to spot them - and we should rather spot and correct them before they cause significant damage. In this post, we will see how various forms of self-auditing can help us avoid cost inefficiency, future outages and security incidents.

## Tis' but a migration

## Secretly committed secrets

## We provision what we need, and quadruple that for a good measure

## This is not how our users behave
