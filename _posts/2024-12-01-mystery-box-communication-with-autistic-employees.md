Communication between neurotypical and neurodivergent individuals is often difficult, and requires patience and eagerness to learn from both sides. According to [double empathy problem](https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/professional-practice/double-empathy), the communication struggles between autistics and allistics (non-autistics) stem from mutual misunderstandings, and difficulty to internalize how the other group sees and interprets the surroundings and communication, rather than autistics' inherent inability to communicate. However, the struggle is real and leads to difficult situations at school, at work and in families - especially given that in most of such settings, what is accepted as a norm or expected as a professional approach is strictly neurotypical, making it difficult for autistics to adapt.

In this post, I attempt to share an autistic perspective on various work-related situations, expectations and communication with neurotypical bosses, colleagues and interviewers. Please be mindful that autistic community is immensely diverse - my experiences is not representative of the entire autistic population. Not all of us experience the same difficulties, and not to the same degree - however, my observations of autistic communities I joined indicates there is some degree of similarity, and parallels can often be drawn.
