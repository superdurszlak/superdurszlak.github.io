Communication between neurotypical and neurodivergent individuals is often difficult, and requires patience and eagerness to learn from both sides. According to [double empathy problem](https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/professional-practice/double-empathy), the communication struggles between autistics and allistics (non-autistics) stem from mutual misunderstandings, and difficulty to internalize how the other group sees and interprets the surroundings and communication, rather than autistics' inherent inability to communicate. However, the struggle is real and leads to difficult situations at school, at work and in families - especially given that in most of such settings, what is accepted as a norm or expected as a professional approach is strictly neurotypical, making it difficult for autistics to adapt.

In this post, I attempt to share an autistic perspective on various work-related situations, expectations and communication with neurotypical bosses, colleagues and interviewers. Please be mindful that autistic community is immensely diverse - my experiences is not representative of the entire autistic population. Not all of us experience the same difficulties, and not to the same degree - however, my observations of autistic communities I joined indicates there is some degree of similarity, and parallels can often be drawn.

## It is not our choice to be autistic

{% capture autism_not_a_choice %}
Throughout my life, I have been asked, ordered, or threatened to stop behaving and reacting the way I did, or to start displaying more neurotypical behaviors and mindset - now, as a late-diagnosed individual, I know for certain these behaviors are quite typical of Autism Spectrum Disorder. Examples include direct communication style, understanding messages at face value, and various forms of stimming - that is, behaviors that help reduce stress and may be more or less noticeable to others, for instance playing with all sorts of fidgets, such as pen or pencil. Failing to meet these expectations often led to punishments, hostility, and retribution.

Autism Spectrum Disorder is a condition that cannot be controlled or undone. Autistic individuals cannot choose to have it or not, or to make the symptoms less severe - just as much as a color-blind person would not start to see differences between various colors if their tried harder. Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition, and not a matter of merely a specific mindset, choice, being immature or unwilling to change.

The belief, or hope that autism can be "cured" or reversed is what lets predatory organizations such as Autism Speaks thrive, and spread misinformation about autism. It also leads neurotypical parents, relatives and employers to set up unrealistic expectations for autistics, and then frustration when we fail to meet these expectations. On the other hand, it is not too convincing to think autistic people would prefer to face negative consequences of being autistic, if we truly had a choice:
- Attracting negative attention,
- Being an easy target for bullies,
- Feeling over-stimulated and stressed by inputs and situations manageable for neurotypical population,
- Being both misunderstood and struggling to understand others,
- Suffering from co-morbidities, such as OCD, anxiety, depression to name a few.

Autism and other types of neurodivergence stem from neurological differences. It is not an individual's choice to have them or not.
