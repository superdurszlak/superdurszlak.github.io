Among all the health conditions, diseases, disabilities and neuro-developmental challenges, it seems that [Autism Spectrum Disorder](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/autism-spectrum-disorders-asd) is notorious for giving everybody a solid headache, no matter how they came to interact with it - as researchers, diagnosticians, autists ourselves or people who just are there around us as our family members, partners, friends or acquaintances.

First of all, there are not a lot of conditions I heard of that would have _spectrum_ in their official name, and this already tells a lot. Have you ever heard of _flu spectrum_ or _sexually transmitted diseases spectrum_, or have you been diagnosed with _depression spectrum disorder_? Me neither, so far, and the reason why autism _is_ one of the few exceptions I have ever encountered is how ridiculously diverse and varied our lot is:
- One may have some over- or under-sensitivities to various sensory stimuli, but this is not exactly mandatory, and both the intensity and type of those sensitivities are a highly individual matter.
- One develops their own coping mechanisms to deal with stress and over-stimulation, which may range from innocent and unnoticeable, through awkward, creepy to even outright illegal.
- The list of deficiencies that can be present or absent in an autist is quite long, and again the intensity and way they manifest themselves varies.
- Even if two individuals act similarly, they may do it for different reasons. Likewise, two autistic individuals may do one particular thing differently, even though they both arrived at their solutions quite rationally and starting with similar assumptions.
- It is not always visible, and this can be due to milder symptoms and/or due to coping mechanisms and masking strategies an autist adopted to better fit into the society.
- Even when some autistic traits are visible, they can be easily confused with other conditions - and vice versa. It is also not impossible for an individual to _both_ be autistic and have that other condition.

Before getting officially diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, I have seen plenty of these traits in myself and I was left wondering for multiple years - is it true, or have I gaslit myself into believing I am autistic? It did not exactly help, too, that diagnosing autism in Poland is far from developed, especially for adults. This, combined with all sorts of prejudice about autism and how it _should_ or _should not_ look like, led to not being diagnosed until adulthood, and attributing my difficulties to _not trying hard enough_ or outright malice.

## 1: Being neurodiverse is a superpower

I will start with a recent observation that autism happens to be advertised as giving us _superpowers_, like problem-solving or perseverance - perhaps in an attempt to be more inclusive and/or soften up the still popular narrative of autism being an end-of-the-world life sentence.

Reality is, as always, more complex, and at least in my case autism makes me neither a superhero, nor a person who cannot take care of themselves in everyday life, with shaking hands and twisted eyes. A more accurate analogy to an autist could perhaps be a [glass cannon](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/glass_cannon) - capable of punching well above my weight if the conditions are right, and if I can leverage my strengths to their fullest, yet at the same time just absurdly helpless and confused in some everyday situations or when expected to act like a non-autist. To give an example from both extremes:
- I am born a problem-solver, and consider problem-solving as one of my fundamental needs - which means that given time and autonomy, I will ponder it until given problem is solved. 
- What is problematic, though, is that it sometimes turns out the problem was not supposed to be solved, or the privilege of solving given problem or class of problems belongs to someone in particular. Or that I was expected to be stuck with this problem indefinitely, and since it is already solved I need to be given something else to do. 
- Either way, perhaps I could realize all of this before it is too late if not for one of my challenges - namely, I do not really read between the lines. Unless I am explicitly told that something should be left as-is just to avoid drama, I will likely fail to spot it if the drama would start right in front of me.
- As if it weren't enough, I am not only poor at reading between the lines in terms of social cues or non-verbal communication, I can also miss the signals entirely. Ask my wife how long it took me to realize we were dating and that she genuinely shown romantic interest in me. Frankly, I trust her simply because she explained it to me multiple times, though I still cannot get it how and why...

## 2: You do not look like an autist

Well, what does an autist look like, then? As mentioned before - it is not about having shaking hands and twisted eyes - at least, not always and not exclusively. 

There are some visual signs you might be talking to an autistic person - for instance, avoiding eye contact and clumsiness - though these arguably have the least impact on my everyday life, and can be practiced - to get more comfortable with making an eye contact, or to improve coordination. Things that have the most profound effect on who we are are those that often cannot be easily seen - you can readily observe I might struggle with interpreting your suggestions or miss the entire context of why you feel upset at me. 

What you cannot see, though, is me not being able to figure out what do you expect of me, or what did you _actually_ try to tell me, why do you feel the way you seem to feel, and becoming increasingly stressed out, because attempts to apply my logical-mathematical skills to resolve this situation only make it worse.

## 3: You could be normal if only you tried harder

No. My - and probably everyone else's - autism stems from factors that cannot be fixed by _trying harder_, cannot be undone, and as of 2024 the advances in medicine still do not allow to _cure autism_. Unless it becomes possible to undo or fix what genes you inherited - yes, autism seems to run in families, too - or somehow re-wire your brain so that it works like that of a neuro-typical person, my traits cannot be fixed.

Best I can do is:
- Having honest conversations with you to improve mutual understanding,
- Developing some coping mechanism here and there, mostly to deal with stressful situations and avoid ones that could get me in trouble - read: _being bullied_,
- Focusing on things I am good at, and ask for help in areas that are problematic for me.

Still, even with all the support, coping mechanisms and masking strategies in place, I would not be _normal_ as in _neurotypical_ - I would only be mimicking and emulating certain patterns and behaviors in particular contexts, though it would be at best superficial, and sooner or later I am going to make another mistake.
