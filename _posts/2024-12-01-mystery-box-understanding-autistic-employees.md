Communication between neurotypical and neurodivergent individuals is often difficult, and requires patience and eagerness to learn from both sides. According to [double empathy problem](https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/professional-practice/double-empathy), the communication struggles between autistics and allistics (non-autistics) stem from mutual misunderstandings, and difficulty to internalize how the other group sees and interprets the surroundings and communication, rather than autistics' inherent inability to communicate. However, the struggle is real and leads to difficult situations at school, at work and in families - especially given that in most of such settings, what is accepted as a norm or expected as a professional approach is strictly neurotypical, making it difficult for autistics to adapt.

In this post, I attempt to share an autistic perspective on various work-related situations, expectations and communication with neurotypical bosses, colleagues and interviewers. Please be mindful that autistic community is immensely diverse - my experiences is not representative of the entire autistic population. Not all of us experience the same difficulties, and not to the same degree - however, my observations of autistic communities I joined indicates there is some degree of similarity, and parallels can often be drawn.

## Can we choose if/when to be autistic?

{% capture autism_not_a_choice %}
Throughout my life, I have been asked, ordered, or threatened to stop behaving and reacting the way I did, or to start displaying more neurotypical behaviors and mindset - now, as a late-diagnosed individual, I know for certain these behaviors are quite typical of Autism Spectrum Disorder. Examples include direct communication style, understanding messages at face value, and various forms of stimming - that is, behaviors that help reduce stress and may be more or less noticeable to others, for instance playing with all sorts of fidgets, such as pen or pencil. Failing to meet these expectations often led to punishments, hostility, and retribution.

Autism Spectrum Disorder is a condition that cannot be controlled or undone. Autistic individuals cannot choose to have it or not, or to make the symptoms less severe - just as much as a color-blind person would not start to see differences between various colors if their tried harder. Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition, and not a matter of merely a specific mindset, choice, being immature or unwilling to change.

The belief, or hope that autism can be "cured" or reversed is what lets predatory organizations such as Autism Speaks thrive, and spread misinformation about autism. It also leads neurotypical parents, relatives and employers to set up unrealistic expectations for autistics, and then frustration when we fail to meet these expectations. On the other hand, it is not too convincing to think autistic people would prefer to face negative consequences of being autistic, if we truly had a choice:
- Attracting negative attention,
- Being an easy target for bullies,
- Feeling over-stimulated and stressed by inputs and situations manageable for neurotypical population,
- Being both misunderstood and struggling to understand others,
- Suffering from co-morbidities, such as OCD, anxiety, depression to name a few.

Autism and other types of neurodivergence stem from neurological differences, including brain structure, and brain activity. It is not an individual's choice to have them or not.

## Masking is self-destructive

{% capture destructive_masking %}
In my case, there is no verbal impairment, and my over-sensitivities are usually manageable, however I still do struggle with social interactions, and have significant difficulty reading between the lines, noticing an interpreting social cues. Typical of milder cases of autism, I can mask my autism to some extent, though it is frequently ineffective. Most notably, I try to withstand stressful situations and stimuli while suppressing my body's stress responses, and attempt to leverage rules, patterns and logic to reason about social interactions.

Neurotypical environments, especially school and workplace, require neurodivergent individuals to behave in neurotypical ways and suppress their individual traits in order to be tolerated. Some autistic individuals are capable of camouflaging their autistic traits in order to meet these expectations - especially those with milder autism, better developed cognitive abilities, and not suffering from verbal impairment. At face value, it may seem tempting to require autistics to mask in order to fit in - after all, neurotypical peers and superiors would not need to leave their comfort zone and adapt to neurodivergence.

Unfortunately, according to [National Autistic Society](https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/topics/behaviour/masking) masking is a highly unhealthy coping strategy that is not only physically and emotionally draining, but also has detrimental effects on individual's health. It puts an autistic person at an elevated risk of developing depression and anxiety disorders - which are already frequent in autistic population. Likewise, while being on the autism spectrum already makes an individual several times more likely to experience suicidal thoughts, and attempt to take their life, suicidal thoughts and behaviors are again even more prevalent in case of masking autistics. Being able to mask means being able to recognize we are not tolerated, let alone accepted, by the society and our environment - a highly depressing thought.

Moreover, masking does not alleviate the underlying struggles of an autistic individual. We apply masking to avoid attracting negative attention, and retribution to our non-neurotypical ways of communication. Internally, we remain just as autistic as we would be without masking - and emulating neurotypical behavior is physically and emotionally draining. It is also only partially effective - the more severe an individual's autistic traits are, the more needs to be done in order to mask them, and the more difficult it is to learn masking strategies in the first place.

{% capture destructive_masking_insight %}
Masking is a strategy some autistic individuals apply in order to appear neurotypical, or at least less autistic than we truly are. It is a strategy that takes its toll on an individual's health, and puts us at a higher risk of anxiety, depression, and suicide - an ultimate price for their environments' convenience.

## Direct communication is crucial

{% capture direct_communication %}
I frequently come across as blunt and rude - on one hand, I fail to recognize non-verbal and nuanced signs, such as when someone uses gestures, tone of voice, metaphors and sarcasm to convey their message indirectly. On the other - when communicating, I tend to speak my mind and communicate directly, at best softening up my statements and cushioning them to some extent. However, if communicating directly is a taboo - such as in some indirect cultures - even cushioned messages are received as arrogant and disrespectful. 
{% endcapture %}
{% include case-study-context.html content=direct_communication %}

One of the most frequently observed autistic traits - and one contributing to our general struggles with social interactions - is the direct and literal we process messages and information. It is inherently difficult for to not only notice, but also interpret all of the non-verbal, nuanced social cues that might have a myriad of meanings depending on context - and the sheer complexity of such interactions is simply overwhelming for us. Interacting with an autistic individual and expecting them to correctly interpret such communication is draining for both sides:
- An autistic may understand - or choose to understand - such message literally, but since the intended message was conveyed indirectly, it leads to misunderstandings;
- Otherwise, they might recognize that their interlocutor conveyed an indirect message or gave social cues - however, the autistic person may see various possibilities and struggle to choose a correct interpretation, or may be oblivious of possible other interpretations altogether;
- If they decide to interpret the social cue, it is likely they miss some context the other person knew and took for granted. In that case, the response of an autistic individual would likely be inconsistent with expectations;
- Another way for an autistic individual might be to ask for clarification and explanation - however, it might lead to conflict as the other person may find this ask to be offensive, breaking a taboo, annoying or questioning their authority in case of superior-subordinate relationship;

In all of these cases, an autistic individual is at a significant risk of mis-communicating with the other person. Regardless of the response, it may, and often does lead to conflicts, which in some cases may escalate. Not being able to properly interpret indirect messages and social cues, an autistic individual has no way of responding in a safe and constructive manner if their interlocutor does not acknowledge the necessity of direct communication.

Likewise, autistic individuals are often misunderstood by neurotypical individuals, who expect hidden meanings and nuances, often seeing them where they are not meant to be. The meaning is laid out in plain sight, however our communication would be combed through for intentions and indirect messages. Our eye contact avoidance or unusual tone of voice can affect how our messages would be interpreted, leading to further misunderstandings and conflicts.

{% capture direct_communication_insight %}
For autistic individuals, it is easier to communicate with neurotypical people if direct and verbal communication is accepted. We struggle with indirectness and nuances, and are often misunderstood by interlocutors looking out for cues we could have accidentally made, while not intending to do so.
